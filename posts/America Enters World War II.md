## America in the World
- While the United States counteracted the effects of the Great Depression with the New Deal, other industrialized nations such as Italy, Spain, and Germany adopted [[fascism]]
- The harsh peace terms imposed on the Central Powers imposed resentment, especially in Germany.
- The United States' failure to join the League of Nations reduced its ability to maintain stability in Europe.
- Germany's expansionist policies caused America to think about going to war, but it was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that finally instigated them to do so.

## The road toward War
- Despite the United States not joining the League of Nations, it still did not withdraw from international affairs.
	- The US participated in arms control negotiations; signed the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] 
	- Expanded foreign investments in areas such as Central/Latin America, Asia, the Middle East, and western Europe; the Roosevelt administration opened diplomacy with the USSR in 19333
- The United States practiced [[isolationism]] in that it *did* prohibit itself from entering international institutions that required military cooperation even though it was still involved in foreign affairs.
- The [[Nye Committee]] hearings concluded that bankers and munition makers pushed the United States to war in 1917, contributing to antibusiness sentiment.
- Congress passed the [[Neutrality Acts]] not long after, making it more difficult for the United States to become involved with European hostilities.
	- They also passed legislation to prohibit the sale of munitions in 1935 to either side and added private loans to the ban the following year.
- Adolf Hitler became chancellor in 1933, reviving Germany's economy and military after the Great Depression.
	- Installed [[Nazism]] at home and the empire of the [[Third Reich]] abroad.
	- Manipulated German feelings of humiliation for losing WWI and signing the "war guilt clause"
	- Sent troops to occupy the Rhineland between Germany and France in blatant violation of the Treaty of Versailles.
	- Forced Austria to unite with Germany in 1938
		- Noticing that Germany was acquiring too much land, Britain and France allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland if he would stop trying to expand eastward with the  [[Munich Accord]].
		- Hitler, however, wanted all of Czechoslovakia, so he invaded the country and nobody did anything in response: a policy called [[appeasement]].
- Mussolini and Hitler intervened in the Spanish civil war, providing support to General Francisco Franco to overthrow their democratic republic, which was successful.

## The Challenge to Isolationism
- FDR responded to the outbreak of all-out war by reaffirming United States [[isolationism]].
- With German victories mounting, isolationsim was further reaffirmed with the creation of the [[America First Committee]].
- The surrender of France to the Germans drastically changed American attitudes to the war: US citizens wanted to help the [[Allies]] in some way without entering war.
- How the Roosevelt administration managed to help Britain:
	- Sent fifty obsolete destroyers to the British in exchange for leases on British naval bases.
	- Persuaded Congress to pass the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]], which registered over 16 million men.
	- Also persuaded Congress to pass the [[Lend Lease Act]] in 1941. 
	- FDR sent naval and air patrols in the North Atlantic to protect British ships, which were attacked by German U-boats. 

## The United States Enters the War
- Churchill and FDR signed the [[Atlantic Charter]] in 1941 proclaiming the defense of freedom for all, which lays the groundwork for the foundation of the United Nations. 
	- Roosevelt also promises Churchill that the US will defend British ships up to Iceland until Germany provokes the Americans in favor of a war declaration.
- FDR persuades Congress to repeal the [[Neutrality Acts]] after several attacks on American ships by German U-boats, paving the way for open support to the UK.
- The United States never challenged the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, but after Japanese forces began occupying China, the US began supplying arms to China.
- Relations with Japan worsened once they signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Germany and Italy.
- Japanese troops also invaded Indochina, and the US embargoed the sale of war products to Japan.
	- The Japanese weren't deterred by this, however; they continued to occupy Indochina and the US responded by cutting off all trade with Japan.
-  In 1941, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, which kills more than 2,400 Americans and damages ships and aircraft. 
	- This ended [[isolationism]] and rallied the American people behind FDR's war declaration.
	- The United States declares war on Japan, and so does Japan, Germany, and Italy. 
	- Congress also passed the [[War-Powers Act]], authorizing the President to reorganize federal agencies as necessary to win the war.
- Roosevelt campaigned on not sending American men to fight overseas, but entry into the war was considered necessary to preserve democracy against fascist and militaristic nations.

## Managing the Home-Front Economy
- Roosevelt increased federal spending to unprecedented levels to prepare for war.
- Federal employment expanded to an all-time high of 3.8 million workers.
- GDP increased, union membership rose, and unemployment dropped because of the war.
- Automobile factories in the northeast and midwest converted to building military vehicles, oil refineries processing gas to fuel them, and steel and rubber factories were repurposed for the war.
- Farm production soared to provide food for the nation and its allies, industrializing the South away from a plantation-based economy.
- The US government established aircraft plants and shipbuilding yards in the West, causing extraordinary population growth.
- FDR established the [[War Production Board]] to oversee the economy, which enticed businesses to negotiate contracts with the government to guarantee larger profits in exchange for completing orders.
- The Roosevelt administration recruited business executives to supervise government agencies, evaporating antibusiness hostility.
- The emergence of the relationship between the government and businesses during the war produced the [[military-industrial complex]].
- The US increased military production substantially, accounting for half of the world's manufacturing output.
	- This took considerable effort (and money), however; the government financed this undertaking by selling $100 billion in bonds and increasing income tax rates.
- Through voluntary enlistments and the draft, the military grew to 12 million men by the end of the war.
- The [[Tuskeegee airmen]], a segregated fighting unit from Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, distinguished themselves in battle.
- Although women couldn't fight in combat, many joined the [[Women's Army Corps]] and the navy's [[Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service]].
	- Women mainly served as nurses and performed transportation and clerical duties.
	- Also worked on decrypting ciphers with British female codebreakers.
- The demands of American wartime production led to a boost in labor union memberships.
	- FDR established the National War Labor Board, which regulated wages, hours, and working conditions, and authorized the government to take over plants that refused to abide by its decisions.
	- After workers protested the disparity between worker wages and corporate profits, Congress passed the Smith-Connally Act, which prohibited walkouts and strikes within a thirty day cooldown.
- The government also created the [[Office of War Information]] to help the war effort and boost American attitudes.

### New Opportunities for Women
- Women employment significantly increased during the war with the shortage of labor from men.
	- However, most of the women working were single women over the age of 35.
	- Women also didn't receive comparable income despite working the same industrial jobs that men did.
- The government did little to encourage young mothers to work, but they didn't provide child care programs widely available either.
- Women were commonly reviewed as "temporary replacements" until the men fighting in war would come back home to go back to work.
- After the war, women were told to leave their jobs and return back home.

### Fighting for Equality at Home
- Defeating Nazism, which was based on racial prejudice, offered blacks a chance to press for equality in the United States.
- In contrast, Japanese Americans experienced discrimination because of anti-Japanese hysteria
	- Many Japanese Americans were even sent to internment camps, which violated their civil rights.
	- They were freed toward the end of the war, but this still left scars.
- Mexican Americans and Indian Americans benefitted from wartime jobs but continued to experience racism.
- In response to Philip Randolph, who planned to lead a march to Washington D.C., FDR passed the Fair Employment Practice Committee, which was dedicated to investigate inequality in the armed forces.
	- The effect of this, however, was nil, since the FEPC did not have enforcement power.
- Black leaders used the [[Double V]] symbol to fight inequality both abroad and at home. 
- The NAACP won *Smith vs Allwright* in Texas, which outlawed all-white Democratic primary elections in the one-party South.
- The [[Congress of Racial Equality]] was also founded in Chicago in 1942, and they protested using sit-ins and marches.
- Population shifts of blacks to the urbanized South caused an increase in violence and racial tensions.
- Immigration from Mexico and Mexican American military enrollment also increased significantly during the war:
	- The United States negotiated with Mexico for contract laborers to work as farm laborers and in factories for a limited time.
	- They ended up striking in the agricultural fields over their poor wages.
- Ignacio Lutero Lopez organized boycotts against businesses that discriminated against Mexican Americans.
- Wartime organization led to the Unity Leagues, which was a coalition of Mexican American business owners, college students, and civil leaders that pressed for racial equality.
- Mexican Americans in Texas also joined the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], which grew quickly and expanded its operations throughout the Southwest.
- Mexican Americans encountered hostility from longtime residents and whites, which increased violence, especially in Los Angeles with the [[zoot suit riots]].
- The Iroquois challenged the US over its right to draft American Indians, but ended up declaring war on the Axis Powers anyway, causing a large number of American Indians to serve in the war.
	- Used secret codes in their native language to confuse the Japanese.
	- Migrating away from their reservations opened up new opportunities for them in the American country and increased their pride in the role that they played in winning the war.
	- The living conditions of most American Indians, however, did not improve after the war, nor did American hostility towards their tribal identities.

## The Ordeal of Japanese Americans
- Japanese Americans received the worst treatment from the civilian population and state/federal officials.
- Although other "Axis races" experienced prejudice, Japanese Americans were more concentrated in specific areas and weren't considered white.
- The [[internment]] of Japanese Americans paled in comparison to other races.
	- This stemmed from [[Executive Order 9066]] authorizing military commanders on the West Coast to take any measures necessary to promote national security and overall hatred towards Japanese Americans.
- Many Japanese Americans were forced to go to internship camps and, if they refused, they were sent to jail, even if they were citizens.
- There was little to no evidence that Japanese Americans were disloyal or spies, but the government chose believed that they as a group threatened national security.
	- In contrast, the governement reviewed German and Italian Americans on a case-by-case basis.
- Canada also incarcerated its Japanese population, 75 percent of whom were citizens.
- Despite selling/renting their homes after internment, Japanese Americans made the best out of this situation: the internment camps provided schools, recreation, and religious facilities other than Shintoism.
- Internees tried to farm, but the land was too arid. People that tried to work jobs within the camp were paid monthly wages of $12-19.
- In response to this, Japanese Americans wrote about their experiences or displayed their feelings via artwork.
	- They also formed community groups and joined the army to contradict the belief that their ancestry made them disloyal.
	- The Supreme Court ruled against the mistreatment of Japanese Americans, deeming it legal. It took until FDR's fourth term for [[Executive Order 9066]] to finally be repealed.
- In contrast, the status of Chinese Americans improved substantially with Congress repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act in observance of the Japanese occupation of China.
- The war opened up jobs to Chinese men and women outside their ethnic economy.
- Most Japanese Americans did not become bitter towards the United States government. They resumed their lives and returned to their communities after the war.
	- However, some Japanese Americans renounced their American citizenship and emigrated to Japan in 1945. 
- It took four decades for Congress to apologize for the mistreatment of Japanese Americans.
	- In 1988, Congress awarded reparations of $20,000 to all living internees.

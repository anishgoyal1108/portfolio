Atomic bombs dropped by the U.S. on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and Nagasaki on August 9. The Hiroshima bomb immediately killed 70,000â€“80,000 civilians. The Nagasaki explosion immediately killed 100,000 civilians. Many survivors of these bombings later developed health issues due to the radiation exposure. Five days after the second bomb was dropped, Japan announced its surrender.

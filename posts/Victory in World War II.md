## Global War Erupts
- The Allies divided over how quickly they needed to mount a counterattack on Germany
	- The USSR demanded the opening of a [[second front]] through France to take some pressure off of its forces.
	- The UK wanted to fight in northern Africa and southern Europe to remove Axis powers  to remove Axis control and rebuild their fighting strength.
	- The US didn't want many casualties, so FDR approved an invasion through France, but first by fighting the Germans/Italians on the periphery of Europe.
- The Allies were successful in removing the Germans from Africa, but it failed in removing political tensions.
	- Stalin was disappointed when he discovered that the second front would not be opening and that the invasion of France would happen through the English Channel instead.
	- FDR gave Stalin unlimited Lend-Lease supplies in response.
- The Allies overcame the German troops over the English Channel in Normandy France, an invasion known as [[D Day]].
	- This invasion was successful, and the Allies regained control of France and Belgium.

## War in the Pacific
- The US began a two-pronged counterattack in the Pacific against Japanese forces headed by Gen Douglass MacArthur.
- Admiral Chester Nimtz also directed the Pacific Fleet from Hawaii to Japanese-occupied islands in the West.
	- This strategy was known as [[island-hopping]].
	- If all went well, MacArthur's ground troops and Nimtz's naval fleet would combine to overwhelm Japan.
	- This also allowed the United States to conduct firebomb raids over Tokyo and other major cities via B-29 bombers, which destroyed Japan's capability to sustain themselves.
- The US defeated the Japanese in the [[Battle of Midway Island]], northwest of Hawaii, a key turning point in the war that fortified military units against Pacific occupation.
- After six months, the Japanese were finally on the defensive.
- In 1945, in preparation for an invasion on the Japanese home islands, the United States won battles at [[Okinawa]] and [[Iwo Jima]], two strategic islands.
- The navy set up a blockade on the Japanese mainland, crippling their economy.
- Despite all of this, however, the Japanese refused to surrender, resorting to *kamikaze* attacks (suicidal airplane crashes) on American ships and planes.

## Ending the War
- On the European front, the Germans launched one last offensive attack from Belgium in the [[Battle of the Bulge]].
	- The Allies sent the Germans retreating over the Rhine River and back into Germany.
- FDR and Churchill met with Stalin in Ukraine over whether postwar Poland would be democratic or not.
	- They came up with the [[Yalta Agreement]], which called for the establishment of permanent governments in Poland and the rest of eastern Europe through free elections.
- The Allies committed to establishing the United Nations and the Soviets reaffirmed their intention to join the war against Japan after Germany's surrender.
- Germany would be divided into four postwar zones, each occupied by the UK, US, USSR, and France.
- Not soon after, Mussolini is assassinated and Hitler commits suicide in his bunker. The remnants of the German government surrender.
- The US developed the atomic bomb via the [[Manhattan Project]]. President Harry Truman issued an ultimatum to Japan to surrender or be annihilated. They refused.
- An atomic bomb was dropped on [[Hiroshima]], but Japan did not surrender in three days, so another one was dropped on [[Nagasaki]].
- Truman reasoned that the dropping of the bombs on the Japanese mainland was necessary and justified given the atrocities by the Japanese on American soldiers previously.

## Evidence of the Holocaust
- The end of the war revealed the horrors of the [[Holocaust]]: as Allies liberated Germany and Poland, they saw the brutality of Nazi concentration camps.
- The Allies encountered the skeletons of inmates tossed into mass graves, dead by starvation, illnesses, and executions.
- Cremations contained the ashes of inmates that were poisoned and then incinerated.
- Evidence of what had happened appeared early in the war, but the Roosevelt administration did nothing because they deemed it was too risky.
- FDR refused to relax immigration laws to allow Jews among other persecuted minorities to seek refuge in the US.
- The United States refused a German liner, the *SS Saint Louis*, containing Jewish refugees because the passengers did not have the proper documents required under the Immigration Act of 1924.
	- The ship went back to Europe, where many of the passengers were later killed in the Holocaust.
- The Japanese also committed atrocities against US soldiers in POW camps where they were forced to work as enslaved laborers under inhumane conditions.
- Japan believed surrender was a cowardly act and killed Americans that surrendered in POW camps. Otherwise, they were enslaved and died anyway.

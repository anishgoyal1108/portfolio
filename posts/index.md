# Welcome to my portfolio!
This site was made using Obsidian Markdown for all the content with [https://github.com/TuanManhCao/digital-garden](Mindstone) as the backend.

## About Me
If you don't know anything about me, my name is Anish Goyal, and I am currently an eleventh grader at the Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology (GSMST). I have a strong passion for computer science and education equity. I enjoy typesetting notes and presentations using LaTeX, Markdown, and Quarto---some may view it as unnecessary, but I consider it art, especially when I get to show off/present them. I also enjoy programming, or just computer science in general, with a heavy emphasis on cybersecurity and machine learning. My hobbies are independent research, gaming, and public speaking. I am the head officer of GSMST Computer Science Club's cybersecurity department, which branches off into Capture the Flag and CyberPatriot (I focus mainly on expanding the CyberPatriot division, but I help in Capture the Flag too!). I'm also an assistant team leader of the GSMST 16796 Red Robodragons First Tech Challenge robotics team with a specialization of programming the bot. I am also currently a Georgia Governor's Honors Program semifinalist with a prospective major in Engineering: Computer Programming. Right now, my favorite class is Applications of Linear Algebra Using Python Programming, but my favorite *teacher* is Mr. Schepens, who teaches my AP Computer Science Principles class. I actually took AP Computer Science A last year before taking AP CSP and Applications of Linear Algebra this year, so I could've chosen not to take it entirely, but I wanted to complete the CTAE Computer Science pathway and have a relaxed class this school year.

## Notes About This Site
- The file structure of this portfolio is a bit unorganized for now (since this is supposed to reflect my mind, I guess that makes sense, haha). 
	- Although, some good places to start would be my [[AP United States History]] and [[Advanced High School Statistics]] notes. 
- Feel free to use the backlinks located at the bottom of every page to go to the parent of a page or the pages in which a particular page appears.
- One cool thing about Obsidian Markdown is that it is completely component-based---you can reference absolutely *anything* that is within a markdown file, whether it is a hyperlink, block of text, image, table, or heading. You can also add tags and group by those tags to see all of the content for a particular topic at a glance. 

## Final remarks
Although this site is technically a *portfolio*, I view it as much more than that. To me, this site is my **mind map**, and I hope that a sufficiently developed mind map could be useful to  you for any topics we may share commonalities with.

Seeing as I am a firm believer in the power of *open source*, any thoughts, projects, notes, or even standalone *files* that I deem "cool" enough are privy to the reaches of the Internet.
